# Health and Fitness Formula Sheet

This document includes common formulas used in nutrition and fitness coaching.

## 1. Body Mass Index (BMI)

**Formula:**

```
BMI = weight (kg) / [height (m)]²
```

**Imperial version:**

```
BMI = (weight (lb) / [height (in)]²) × 703
```

**BMI Categories:**
- Underweight: <18.5
- Normal: 18.5–24.9
- Overweight: 25–29.9
- Obese: ≥30

---

## 2. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)

**Mifflin-St Jeor Equation (more accurate):**

- For men:
```
BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) + 5
```
- For women:
```
BMR = 10 × weight (kg) + 6.25 × height (cm) − 5 × age (years) − 161
```

---

## 3. Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)

**Formula:**

```
TDEE = BMR × Activity Factor
```

**Activity Factors:**
- Sedentary (little or no exercise): 1.2  
- Lightly active (light exercise/sports 1–3 days/week): 1.375  
- Moderately active (moderate exercise 3–5 days/week): 1.55  
- Very active (hard exercise 6–7 days/week): 1.725  
- Extra active (very hard exercise, physical job): 1.9

---

## 4. Calorie Goals

- **Fat Loss**: TDEE − 250 to 500 kcal  
- **Muscle Gain**: TDEE + 250 to 500 kcal  
- **Maintenance**: TDEE ± 0 kcal

---

## Notes:
- Weight in kg = pounds ÷ 2.2046
- Height in cm = inches × 2.54


---

## 5. Body Fat Percentage Estimation

### Navy Method (uses tape measurements):

- For men:
```
Body Fat % = 86.010 × log10(waist − neck) − 70.041 × log10(height) + 36.76
```

- For women:
```
Body Fat % = 163.205 × log10(waist + hip − neck) − 97.684 × log10(height) − 78.387
```

**Units:** All measurements in inches.

---

## 6. Lean Body Mass (LBM)

```
LBM = weight × (1 − body fat %)
```

---

## 7. Macronutrient Split (per calorie goal)

**1 gram of:**
- Protein = 4 kcal
- Carbohydrate = 4 kcal
- Fat = 9 kcal

### Example Split for Moderate Fat Loss:
- Protein: 30%
- Carbs: 40%
- Fat: 30%

**Formulas:**
```
Protein grams = (Total Calories × 0.30) ÷ 4
Carbs grams   = (Total Calories × 0.40) ÷ 4
Fat grams     = (Total Calories × 0.30) ÷ 9
```

Adjust % depending on goal (e.g., higher protein for muscle building, lower carbs for fat loss).

## 8. Protein Intake Guidelines

- Sedentary adults: 0.8 g/kg body weight
- Active adults: 1.2–2.0 g/kg body weight
- Muscle gain: 2.0–2.2 g/kg
- Fat loss (preserving lean mass): 2.2–2.6 g/kg
